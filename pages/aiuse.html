<h1>How do I use AI?</h1>
<body>
    <p><strong>
    As this is only my second project, I am still in the process of learning the fundamentals of CSS. My primary
    approach involves writing CSS code and, when I encounter issues achieving the desired outcome, I input my code into
    ChatGPT to identify any errors. Typically, it provides guidance on what I may have done incorrectly, allowing me to
    return and make the necessary adjustments. While this method is proving beneficial for my learning, I intend to
    minimize my reliance on AI assistance in future projects. I believe that relying on AI to generate code can inhibit
    my understanding of the underlying principles, ultimately hindering my growth as a developer.
